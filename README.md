This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will accept a personal loan using logistic regression. The dataset includes features such as income, family size, education level, online banking usage, and credit card spending. We applied data visualization techniques to explore patterns and trends, helping us better understand the data. A correlation matrix revealed that income and credit card spending have a strong positive relationship with loan acceptance, while education and online banking usage also play significant roles. Overall, this beginner-friendly project demonstrates how basic machine learning techniques can assist banks in making smarter, data-driven decisions.
